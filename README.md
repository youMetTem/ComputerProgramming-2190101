# TemtemComProg
**temtem's speedrun version of comprog solution** (NANO 21's section), but don't copy me seriously.

In 2024, seniors either had midterms and a final, or just three exams (with no midterm or final). In 2025, it's only the latter.
- **00_GraderSolution_2025**: Answers to all 2025 grader problems
- 01_Exam1_2024: Problems and Answers to 2024 Exam1
- 02_Exam1_2025: Problems and Answers to 2025 Exam1 (morning and afternoon section)
- 03_Midterm_2023: Problems and Answers to 2023 Midterm exam
- 04_Exam2_2024: Problems and Answers to 2024 Exam2
- 05_Exam3_TH_2022: Problems and Answers to **Thai program** 2022 Exam3
- 06_FinalProject_ParrotTalkingDiscordBot: My own final project (10% of the grade)

All of the solutions in this repo were timed during each attempt, so not all of the code is well-written or fully optimized. It was written in a rushed, speedrun manner, so don't expect it to have the lowest possible time complexity.

# Important Note (2025)
- In 2025, due to rates of student withdrawals and failures, the boundary for a F grade has been adjusted downward from 50% to 45%. (A is still kept at 80%)
- Grader Exam 1, 2 Redemption: Student who score below the maximum on exam 1, 2 have a redemption opportunity on the subsequent grader exam. This involves solving a similar problem set to fix or replace the initial score.
- **A perfect score on all three Grader Exam automatically secures a final course grade of A**, regradless of performance in the attendance check, homework submission, final project, or extra credit (exam 1, 2, 3 scores add up to 80% of the final grade).

This Notion link, shared by a senior, provided me an advance access to the 2024 grader problems and their well-written solutions. Note that the 2025 version is slightly different, as some problems were changed, added, or removed.
